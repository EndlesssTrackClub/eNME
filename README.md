### Sorry What

A dopey Discord "bot" that can generate new music genres procedurally and blop them into a discord channel either on-demand or as a cron job to delight and upset.

It pulls images from Bing to use as a background and makes little swatches to present the new genre.

It's not very fancy, it was built to just work for our use.
